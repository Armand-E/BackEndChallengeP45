# BackEndChallengeP45
The Mars Rover BackEnd Challenge as part of the Platform45 / Velocity Media Process. 

Hi and Welcome to my code for the Backend Mars Rover Challenge.

I have chosen to complete the challenge in the Python programming language as this is a language I am quite comfortable in using for backend type dev work.

# To run the code, kindly do the following:

	1. Open your Terminal/Command Prompt.
	2. Change to the directory of "main" where main_MarsRvr.py is in.
	3. Execute the following command: python main_MarsRvr.py
	4. Follow the on screen prompts.

Thank you once again for taking the time to meet with me as well as taking the time to review my code for this challenge.
